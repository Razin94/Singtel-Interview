I started the assignment at 9:40am 21 May 2020 and this is what i was able to produce in the time alloted

1a. Applying JUnit to carry out the test. Simple test to check if their is an output as well as if the ouptut is the exected result

1b. I used interfaces and abstract methods to allow each class to implement their own process for each method. Interfaces also extends the main animal one to reduce inherit all the common abstract methods

Each answer was coded to my perception that would be readable and allow for much better implementation to the best of my ability
